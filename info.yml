      dictionary should contain two key value pairs; entity name and entity field name.
          entity: <PublishedFile>
          field: <entity>

      For the simple case where you just want to show a given set of
      entity types, use :meth:`restrict_entity_types`. This method is
      a more complex restriction suitable for workflows around publishing
      and review.

      This method will look at the given link field (e.g. ``PublishedFile.entity``)
      and inspect the shotgun schema to see which entity types are valid connections
      to this field (e.g. in this example which entity types can you can associate
      a publish with) and those types will appear in the list of items shown by the
      auto completer.

      This is useful when you want to use the context widget in conjunction with
      workflows related to for example publishes, versions or notes and you want to
      restrict the entities displayed by the auto completer to the ones that have been
      configured in the shotgun site schema to be able to associate with the given type."
